23/Oct/2024

- Up early to shinkansen going to Mishima station. Got bento box and got on the train.
- Seat next to us had been booked and I started my bento (katsu and chicken) but we kept pausing every stop in case someone took the seat but nobody ever did.
- Had pre booked expressway bus but north and south exit both have platform 2 and realised we were on wrong side of station but no way through so we had to run all the way around with our packs on. Very exhausting. Finally got into it.
- Kawaguchi station and took local bus we paid too much for to accomodation. 
- Had arrived early at the Umeya annex which is the last used residence of an Oshi spiritual guide for Mt Fuji hikers. In peak time there were 150 Oshi.
- Old guy was surprised at us being only two, we were also early. Seemed a bit annoyed, presumably because of money loss.
- Walked down for lunch at Hotou Fudou. Chaotic place. Huge old seeming building with blackened beams and old samurai portraits but i couldn't find history online to explain it.
- Place served essentially one dish of thick udon noodles with chunks of stewed veggie in a soup, all served in a giant mettle pot. It was ok at best. Bok choy and pumpkin eh.
- The staff were all constantly running and shouting at the top of their lungs as the shop was too big for the number of staff and there was a long queue. All sweating profusely. We couldn't work out why it would be neccesary unless fun or performative. 
- Back to accomodation slightly later than we said and made another faux pas as the host was going out and we had made him wait (to do work around the garden). 
- Checked us in as tersely as is possible (not quite) as a polite Japanese person is able to and ae met his hitler stache cat called "Kuro chan", just meaning "black".
- Got our bike seat heights adjusted (the maximum was still too low for me and looked quite silly).
- Bikes were of a casual Woman's style with the low central bar and no gears and a basket at the front. Mine would skip chain segments and had squeaky brakes.
- Bikes had ingenous features. Key lock that just put a bar between spokes. Dynamo front lights. Bike stand that automatically disengages when you move forward.
- Sat inside for a while and contemplated as the weather outside was raining and cloudy and we couldn't see Fuji. 
- The afternoon was wearing on and the weather was spotty rain so we decided to just take the bikes out and brave it.
- Rode to a little cafe in a traditional Japanese house and had a really nice Matcha brownie. Owner had really good english and I think she'd come back to set up this sort of cafe/craft experience/coworking space.
- Seemed cool but we had to scoff before closing time.
- Rode down the road in twilight to lake Kawaguchi, parked the bikes and walked along the little lakeside track.
- As the light faded, the scene was so beautiful that I was almost brought to tears. The huge dark lake, surrounded by foggy mountains with patches of autumn colour speckling the green trees. Little decorative grass paths and old, gnarled trees. Little lake shrines and ducks and swans on the water, the call of eagles echoing through the valley.
- Noticed a strange French/Italian replica of a complex on our walk and realised it to be the "Musical Forest Museum", which we would visit the [[japan-day31|next day]].
- Rode back to the house and waited a while before riding off for dinner, finding limited options.
- Beautiful ride to small restaurant run by old couple. Met a young French couple outside that were travelling the world with their 3 young children for a year which sounded both very nice and very daunting.
- Great atmosphere, very homey and had a huge beer and felt good. Skewers were really nice but took ages to come out so we chatted a long while.
- Got free chopsticks which was odd and cute and useless.
- Ride back home very fun and a bit wobbly.
