## English
- Eggs for breaky. Out to knife festival for another look. Got wildlife flip knife. Lucca knife for parents.
- Walked to train. Very cute old style tiny red train. Ticket guys waiting at the station in the sun in their nice clothes and polished shoes and hats and little coin bowl. Train had lots of art and very unique seats.
- Mino looked like tiniest town yet with clearly visible urinal from station.
- Cute little family deli had cheese and pork stick, potato, ham croquette, katsu sandwiches.
- Washi prints, cat mug, lots of lanterns including minecraft and maybe pokemon.
- Washi making old man. Looked a little boring doing it for so long.
- Cafe in museum thing.
- Back to Seki and underground temple maze in darkness. Had a dungeon experience of feeling the draft.
- Dinner at chain katsudon place, sat with feet under and ate so fast. Rushed off to boat with mum charging ahead. Felt like a party adventuring through the dark jungle.
- Cormorant fishing was very interesting. Flame ball constantly fed to scare fish out of rocks. 12 cormorants run by a master, helper who rows and hits boat and a steersman. 
- Drunk businessmen offered us beers and sake and tea and fish cake and coke. Knew a few english words but harkens back to sharing culture.
