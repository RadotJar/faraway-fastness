This morning we got up before dawn and only just missed the sunrise over Miyajima from our bedroom window. We brushed our teeth and said a  final goodbye to Yo-san before we took one final trek down the hill to the Miyajimaguchi train station. Before we left, Yo-san took a cute photo of us and called us "Kawaii", reminding us that we were the fictional characters from Studio Ghibli's "The Floating Castle". He also told us that our planned destination of Mount Daisen was really only a skiing destination and that we should see "Sandankyo" instead. From what I understood this is some sort of river delta or perhaps a gorge where three rivers meet. It was a bit too far off our course unfortunately but it did give us the idea to take a few other detours on our drive to Daisen.

Today we had to pick up our hire car from a Nissan hire car shop near Hiroshima at 9am, hence the early wake up. We took a train and two busses to get there from Miyajima. This was our first bus catching attempt and I was a bit apprehensive but my girlfriend assured me that we could just pay cash when on the bus. We boarded and communicated to the bus driver using hand gestures that we wanted two tickets. He managed "after" and so we sat down and tried to figure out exactly how the prices worked. 

Above the bus windscreen were a pair of screens displaying a table with numbers from 1 to 10 and associated prices that would gradually fill in as the bus drove on. We assumed the numbers were associated to a bus stop count but we couldn't work out whether they represented the number of stops travelled or a count of stops yet to come. When we did finally get off the bus and approached the driver, he spat out a number that didn't match any of our calculations. He was very helpful though and used the ticket machine for us, giving us our change. We later realised that there's a ticket machine at the entry door of the bus and you probably take one and then insert that and pay the calculated cost on exit. We haven't been able to test this theory yet.

The bus dropped us on a seemingly random main street in a suburb of Hiroshima. My girlfriend had the address of the car hire shop in her phone and we followed it to an even more random car park in the back streets of this suburb. This was our first "oh no we are lost and going to be late for something important" moment. After a bit of messing around with the internet dongle on some unlucky person's doorstep (there is not much footpath in Japan), I just typed "Nissan" in my phone ans found the place that way. On the walk there, I started recognising things and realised we had walked past them in the other direction only minutes ago. As we approached the Nissan shop, we saw a bus stop come into view... the exact bus stop we had disembarked the bus at. This stop was right in front of the Nissan shop. A very silly but entertaining moment that serves as a reminder to just look up every now and then.

- Guy was so funny "are you ok"
- Cute little blue car Nissan Micra
- Drove to first bakery we found. First ever japanese only menu with some help. Breakfast plate with drink and dessert.
- Then drove on highways through lush Japanese forrest, beautiful mountains and little valley towns.
- Silver mine and left quickly. Mostly Japanese and entry fee a bit expensive
- Soba noodle shop in Oda. No English at all but so lovely helping us understand how to eat. Local specialty Izumo soba and we got free sweet egg roll thing. Learnt "wakarimasu" meaning to understand.
