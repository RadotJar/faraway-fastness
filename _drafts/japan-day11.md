## English (WIP)
- Got little treats from a treat shop and said goodbye to the little cat bibi and owners of hostel. Got drinks and sandwhiches.
- Walked to beach but quite rainy. Beach was full of washed up rubbish including an old rusty gas bottle (industrial). Little crabs in sand.
- Sat on a rock and ate our treats while getting salt spray and rain.
- Beach wasn't very nice, dark and rocky sand. 
- Got in car and drove to sushi chain place. Cool trains but our first bad meal, food was poor quality and a lot of seafood.
- Navigated into Osaka, parked car in a coin parking and got into accomodation. Very spacious but weird layout. 
- Bus to airport to get family. Waited a long time and signs lied to us.
- Navigated buying new Icoca card, refilling existing etc.
- Back to accomodation. Got sorted and walked around Osaka looking for Izakaya. Got overwhelmed and went back to place across from accomodation. Nice old women.
