# The Faraway Fastness

This is my digital garden, tended as often as I see fit. At the moment, it contains many notes on my personal thoughts, 
as well as serving as a hub for my Adventurer Conquerer King campaign.

## Basic Information

- Based on Jekyll, a static website generator
- Supports Roam-style double bracket link syntax to other notes
- Creates backlinks to other notes automatically
- Features link previews on hover
- Includes graph visualization of the notes and their links
- Features a simple and responsive design
- Supports Markdown or HTML notes

## Contributing

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. [`Install rbenv through git`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-git-checkout).
3. Navigate into the project's root directory and run `rbenv install`. This will instruct your machine to install and use the ruby version specified in `.ruby-version`.
4. [`Install ruby gems`](https://rubygems.org/pages/download).
5. Navigate into the project's root directory and run `bundle` to install all required gems.
6. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` to serve a page on localhost. The page will refresh automatically on changes.
7. Check `TODO.md` if you want to work on one of my ideas for the project.
8. Open a PR to main once you have changes you'd like to contribute.

### Development Guidelines

I want to keep this project as vanilla as possible, using plain HTML, CSS, JS and markdown.
It is first and foremost a statically generated site for displaying simple text notes, keep that in mind.

I recommend reading about [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), the static site generator that this project uses.
There you can find an explanation for the project's layout.
