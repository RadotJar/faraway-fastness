- Toast and croissant breakfast not very filling and all pre packaged. Rushed to onigiri and got change.
- Met guide. Got to bus. Bus full and two waited for next while others went to get the car. Bus came even though we were told 30 minutes. 
- Learnt that the bus screens showed price from the number listed on your ticket.
- Many things learnt about Nakasendo. Five roads to Edo and year on year off system. 100s of Samurai or 1000s during later Edo when power was diminishing and had to show off.
- Rare princess tours were extra special. Avoided the south road which had a gate which was for escaping toxic marriages. Even on the Nakasendo they covered up the tree of severence which people pray to for exit of toxic marriage or addiction.
- Inns for daimyo in the post towns were very lavish. Each had one especially and each had secret bodyguard places to watch over daimyo. In the ceiling or passages under the Inn etc.
- Sensory experiences on the tour including rubbing various leaves and smelling. Eating szechuan. Helped make it memorable and struck by how well he knew the area, poggers guide moment. 
- Guide was a hunter. Explained how he was a Vegan turned hunter who explained how he traps boar and deer and kills them. Pelts often go to waste but he butchers the meat and eats it. Slow cooks and said Venison is chewy as a steak.
- Cobblestones section.
- Straw shoes (find the name) are decently easy to make and when wet, mould to your feet. Very grippy. 
- Canon god of horses with the horse hat. Little stone shrine to a dead horse so they have a good afterlife and leave farmer alone. Very useful thing to have, a horse, worth more than all your sons combined probably.
- Also cow canon for all the black oxen who died taking building materials down a slope.
- Lunch at little tea shop. Woman gave gifts to the guide for his family whi gave gifts to her because she gave gifts for birth of their child. 
- Urinal shorter than me.
- Free housing in rurual places due to population reduction. Lots of abandoned houses that families cant take care off.
- Cheap education, even for alternative schooling like forest school.
- Other tea room was 250 years old. All blackened inside from constant fire. Huge 
- Other abandoned tea house made of bark. Some 70s guy who dreamt of it and built his little tea house. Everything was there including toasters, clothes, pictures, crockery etc. Really cool to see and looks like someone just died and nobody took over (true).
- Crazy bus ride. Hard to stand around all the mountain bends. Couldn't see more than a few meters ahead of the bus.
