- Up early to shinkansen going to Mishima station. Got bento box and got on the train.
- Seat next to us had been booked and I started my bento (katsu and chicken) but we kept pausing every stop in case someone took the seat but nobody ever did.
- Had pre booked expressway bus but north and south exit both have platform 2 and realised we were on wrong side of station but no way through so we had to run all the way around with our packs on. Very exhausting. Finally got into it.
- Kawaguchi station and took local bus we paid too much for to accomodation. 
- Had arrived early at the Umeya annex which is the last used residence of an Oshi spiritual guide for Mt Fuji hikers. In peak time there were 150 Oshi.
