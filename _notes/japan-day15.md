## English (WIP)
- Got up so early and hailed taxi so easily, cheaper than a booked DiDi.
- Baked stuff from basement. Weird french potato sausage, good chocolate croissant and curry puff and starbucks.
- Got on bus and did rpg writing and reading japanese book and some Osaka information. Day very cloudy but not yet rainy. Two rest stops and almost tried vending machine coffee. Onigiri lunch.
- Arrived at Takayama, immediately very white people touristy, got into our dorm. Went out, got mochi and very nice owner who had a special 3 layer mochi and 1 year business birthday.
- Dinner at weird noodle place that was packet noodles but still very yummy. Guy was odd and a bit expensive. Us and an american couple who greeted another American and said "take a menu and sit down, its a one person operation".
- Walked and tried to find Sake and got wet and cold. 
- Went to see green tea man dressed in green. Very friendly despite loud tourists.
- Settled at a bar run by one guy which seems like a theme. Nice guy who kept his head despite it being busy. Had a really good Osaka wheat beer that rivalled German ones. Also yuzu beer from the really nice Japanese red owl brewery but it was a bit ew.
