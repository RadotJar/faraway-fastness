## English (WIP)

This morning we headed to the main train station in Hiroshima which was truly bustling. People going in and out of so many passages all leading down to trains going in all directions from the Urban hub. We had found a cafe online that was in the station and went there to find it didn't open until 11am, something we would come to find is very typical of cafes and restaurants. Luckily a friendly station volunteer came up to us and although my initial response was that we didn't need any help, she pressed on and recommended another cafe that was open. We shuffled into our booth with our big rucksacks on and had a little breakfast. The cafe seemed to be trying to emulate a French or perhaps generic European style but the menu consisted of Japanese curry and unusual takes on a continental breakfast. Two fingers of brioche with a boiled egg, for example. I was very excited that they had Vienna coffee as it reminds me of Vienna coffee in the Vienese streets. The coffee wasn't fantastic but it scratched the itch.

Our first challenge of the day was getting tickets for a local train. Compared to the Shinkansen we had taken to Hiroshima, this was a bit more of an exercise. We bumbled around the ticket machines for a while before deciding that we'd better get some help. There was a specific line for foreigners seeking assistance and I felt a bit sheepish joining the queue but it had to be done.

- Tickets were confusing but interpretor helped us.
- Packed train we were very huge in our large bags. Lots of foreigners aboard headed for Miyajima
- Long hot walk up a hill to accomodation. Gelati on the way (Peach and strawberry). Host is very funny and interesting man. Conspiracies, life story, great advice about hidden gems.
- Dinner at place near wharf. 
- Confusing ferry terminals, very quiet
- Came home and met Alon, made plans for next morning
