title: Play by Mail Diplomacy
---

As some players live at the same address, it is important to be clear who the mail is addressed to. For example: To Italy, From France.

Orders must be received by the game master by the last day of each month. Order letters should be labelled 'Country's Orders: Year X, Spring/Autumn'. For example: 'France's Orders: Year 1901, Spring'.
As the game master is also a player, orders will not be opened until the first day of each month. To keep the game fair for those who need to send their mail earlier than others, only the first order submission will be accepted for each country. If orders are not received by the last day of the month for whatever reason, including being lost by the postal service, all units of that country will Hold.
