- Did our washing and put it in the bathroom heat mode to dry. Once again mentioning that these tiny plastic bathrooms seem to move when I'm in them. Not sure if its a claustraphobia thing or relative size illusion.
- Went to Nishiki market. Very crowded street similar to the produce markets back home. Once again decided it isn't worth the crowds for this.
- Lots of ingredients etc. Maybe a handful of ready to eat places with wagyu allegedly not A5 and seafood skewers etc. Underwhelming.
- One of the side streets had a touristy pancake place. Very nice pancakes and coffee despite the wait time. Packed with tourists and feel like one of the many cookie cutter white couples.
- Met my mum on a corner to watch the parade in Kyoto. Goes through the various ages in Japan's history with costumes of the period. Some were even meant to be real figures with flag with their name I think. 
- Large flags of periods seemed not to be referencing the groups that came after so was  hard to follow. First sign said Meiji restoration ans nobody was between them and next flag.
- Cool samurai and princesses.
- Some very active or loud groups with instruments but lots of quiet walkers.
- Some people very smiley and posing for photos, most a bit dreary and just plodding along.
- Was cool to see, didn't watch it all as went for ages.
- Back to accomodation, plan out Shinkansen for the next day.
- Out to Pontocho park to look for live musicians. Found one with a very singsong voice and sat and listened for a while. Broke a string. Girlfriend asked him in Japanese if they were his songs and he understood and shared his youtube.
- Went to a little parfait place for dessert. Weird little room with black door and black shuttered hole into kitchen. Order on terminal and they put food through the hole.
- Not sure if its so they don't need to manage a front of house or if its for their safety or what.
