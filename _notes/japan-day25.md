title: Japan Day 25. Nakatsugawa and Nagoya
---

18/Oct/2024

- Early rise and slimey breakfast before bus back to Nakatsugawa.
- Brief coffee stop at river bed and then on the train to Nagoya
- Two subways to accom. One was a loop which I hadn't seen. Use of the term "wicket". Need to find out more.
- Quiet pedestrian street with accomodation. Maybe fake bird noises. Cafe on the ground floor and guesthouse upstairs with extra annex space. At first seemed like a cute idea. White guy in the kitchen.
- Later found out it was famous for its egg sandwiches. One review said "Did anyone else come to Nagoya for the egg sandwiches. I shat myself. 1 star".
- Explain layout of hostel with box beds and japanese room and common area. Samurai in room and tatami and little japanese harp (nara harp?). Lucca tuned and played smoke on the water. Also had "go" game table (throwback to Osaka).
- Walked to a little cafe for lunch but was after 3 so everywhere was closed, even places that said open. Cafe in old school building and could only get 1 food item. Offered us what we wanted if we waited 20 minutes but nah. Another rice and fish and raw egg meal I couldn't eat the egg and it was only ok.
- Meanwhile washing undies. Back to accomodation and difficult to hand everything up. Had a little hallway we were able to string the line in (maybe explain layout). Dryer did very little.
- Went to department store with cameras and internal camping area. Funny fake camping with plastic foods while mum looked at equipment. 
- Got disposable film camera. Mum wanted more for tax free but the old trap of tax free 5 but spend extra 3.
- Food court top level maze and gave up.
- Australian bar and grill for dinner. Really loud american rap music including Drake on the DJ set. Music fee of 500yen we thought would be live but was DJ.
- American chef and owned by Indian Australian. Food surprisingly good though. Dudes playing chess to twerk music. Smoking inside phenomenon.
- Back home, white dudes upstairs snd maybe Northern or Eastern European chatting in common room. Went out to a wine bar.
- Little place on third storey. Just a bar with chairs and a couple running it, wondered if their house. One businessman in there. Had a really good set up with high tech equip and cutting fish thinly.
- Got some wines. Said no to other food. One wine from very close to where we live, funny.
- Talked amongst ourselves until she asked questions and we had a bit of conversation but better at talking than comprehending.
- Epiphany about condescending minimal words talk actually being less confusing.
- Left no more enlightened about Nagoya apart from "bousho" meaning a shogun almost but not really.
- Guys still talking really late in common room about how hard it is to live in Japan as a non Japanese. Big dude big stomps and plonk into bed.
