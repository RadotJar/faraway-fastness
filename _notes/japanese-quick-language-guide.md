title: Japanese Quick Language Guide
---
ðŸŒ±

As my trip to Japan comes to an end, I feel inspired to write a quick and practical guide for the aspiring not-completely-ignorant tourist. 

Here are the things I believe would be the most useful to spend your learning time on if you want to get by in Japan, in order of usefulness.

## Basic phrases
These are the basic things you should be able to say and understand verbally, but not  necessarily be able to read. Writing is completely off the menu for this quick guide.

### Excusing yourself
Excuse me, to get attention, to apologise - sumimasen

### Giving Thanks
Thankyou (spam this) - arigato gozaimasu.
Thankyou (final such as when leaving a store or bus) - arigato gozaimashita.

### Greetings
Good Morning (before 10am maybe?) - ohio gozaimasu (don't need to pronounce the u)
Good Day (10am - sunset) - konichiwa
Good Evening - konbanwa

Not many people really say goodbye in formal settings like shops and restaurants, just say "arigato gozaimashita" when leaving.

## Katakana
Learn to read katakana by following [this guide](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/) and doing [this quiz](https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com/) as the guide suggests. Learn the katakana section by section, do the quiz until comfortable and then move onto the next section. Once you've got all katakana in your quizzes, do it at least once every day.

If you can read katakana, you don't really need to know any other Japanese to understand it. Just read it out loud and your knowledge of English will give you the meaning. As an example: "ã‚«ãƒ¬ãƒ¼ãƒ©ã‚¤ã‚¹â€œ is read as "ka re ra i su" and it means "curry rice". 

Katakana will help you endlessly in figuring out Japanese food menus and signs, even if you need to stop for a moment and read slowly.
