title: Collaborative Worldbuilding

ðŸŒ±

## A Process

My first [[digital gardening]] project is developing my procedure for collaborative worldbuilding in the public eye. This procedure should be a great way to get your TTRPG group together and generate a world you are all excited to adventure in. This is especially handy for [[sandbox-play]].

### Goals

- Get players invested in the game and world from the beginning.
- Produce character creation and adventure hooks.
- Avoid 'blank slate' mental blocks for the busy GM trying to build a fantasy world.

### Steps
#### 1. Individual Brainstorm
- Set a one minute timer. Everyone writes down as many words related to fantasy worlds as they can **unfiltered**
- Restart the timer. Everyone goes through their list and writes the first word that comes to mind for each word they read in the first round.
- Set a two minute timer. Everyone curates their list, removes word pairs that make no sense or seem uninteresting.

These lists can be used in all future steps as a font of inspiration and unique ideas, especially if people get stumped.

#### 2. Group Truths
This step is inspired by [this blog post by New School Revolution](https://newschoolrevolution.com/2020/02/19/build-your-world).

- Each player names a broad truth about the shared world.
- No player should contradict another player's truth.
- I think it would he useful to use the classic fantasy setting as an assumed baseline and make the truths focus on highlighting deviations from this.
- If it feels necessary, another round of truths could be illicited.

### 3. Character Creation
This step takes inspiration from games where collaborative worldbuilding is built into charactee creation, such as [Beyond the Wall](https://www.flatlandgames.com/btw/).

- Follow the usual character creation steps of your chosen system.
- Each player briefly describes their character's family history. What role did they play in the character's society? What effect did this have on the character.
- Each player playing a human character describes how they distinguished themselves as a child. Were they the toughest in the village? A loner, preferring playing with animals to the other children?
- Each player playing a non-human character describes their reason for leaving their own society and coming to the realm of man.
