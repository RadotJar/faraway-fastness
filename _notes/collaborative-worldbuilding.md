title: Collaborative Worldbuilding

ðŸŒ±

## A Process

My first [[digital gardening]] project is developing my procedure for collaborative worldbuilding in the public eye. This procedure should be a great way to get your TTRPG group together and generate a world you are all excited to adventure in. This is especially handy for [[sandbox-play]].

### Goals

- Get players invested in the game and world from the beginning.
- Produce character creation and adventure hooks.
- Avoid 'blank slate' mental blocks for the busy GM trying to build a fantasy world.

### Steps
#### 1. Individual Brainstorm
- Set a one minute timer. Everyone writes down as many words related to fantasy worlds as they can **unfiltered**
- Restart the timer. Everyone goes through their list and writes the first word that comes to mind for each word they read in the first round.
- Set a two minute timer. Everyone curates their list, removes word pairs that make no sense or seem uninteresting.

These lists can be used in all future steps as a font of inspiration and unique ideas, especially if people get stumped.

#### 2. Group Truths
This step is inspired by [this blog post by New School Revolution](https://newschoolrevolution.com/2020/02/19/build-your-world).

- Each player names a broad truth about the shared world.
- No player should contradict another player's truth.
- I think it would he useful to use the classic fantasy setting as an assumed baseline and make the truths focus on highlighting deviations from this.
- If it feels necessary, another round of truths could be illicited.

### 3. Character Creation
This step takes inspiration from games where collaborative worldbuilding is built into charactee creation, such as [Beyond the Wall](https://www.flatlandgames.com/btw/).

- Start by following the usual character creation steps of your chosen system. 

(I'll be using ACKS which provides nice little templates within the mechanical classes for hints at a backstory through proficiencies and equipment.)

#### 3a. Childhood (Optional)
- Each player briefly describes their character's family history. What role did they play in the character's society? What effect did this have on the character.
- Each player adds a location to the town map related to their upbringing.
- Each player playing a human character describes how they distinguished themselves as a child. Were they the toughest in the village? A loner, preferring playing with animals to the other children?
- Each player playing a non-human character describes their reason for leaving their own society and coming to the realm of man.
- Each player ties their character to an individual or group within the starting town, creating an NPC in the process.

#### 3b. Early Career
- Each player briefly describes their core character concept. They might not know much about their character as a person, but they probably have a fantasy trope or role in mind  (grizzled warrior, devout crusader, wandering mystic etc.)
- After a player has desribed the concept, the rest of the group should ask clarifying questions. "You say you're grizzled, what happened to make you that way? How have you spent your long fighting career?". This can be quite a freeform discussion but the DM may need to do some wrangling if things go too long or get off topic. The idea is to find out how the character got their core abilities and other defining features.
- Each player should add a location to the shared town map related to these fleshed out backstory details. The location need not be in the town proper, but it should at least be close by.
- Each player should come up with an escapade their character survived with the character of the player to their right.
- Each player should come up with a unique item they have from their past. Something to set up future troubles and hint at more backstory yet to be discovered.
- Each player should create an NPC in the starting town related to their early career.
