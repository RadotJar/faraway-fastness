- Woken up by loud hair drying. May aswell take a shower as didn't last night to avoid noise despite loud common room guys.
- Little cafe on the main road for breakfast. Toast and a drink set. Coffee the best so far in Japan. Many toast varieties but got raspberry jam and it was literally jam on toast but nice jam.
