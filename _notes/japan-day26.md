19/Oct/2024

- Woken up by loud hair drying. May aswell take a shower as didn't last night to avoid noise despite loud common room guys.
- Little cafe on the main road for breakfast. Toast and a drink set. Coffee the best so far in Japan. Many toast varieties but got raspberry jam and it was literally jam on toast but nice jam.
- Walked to Nagoya castle. Extremely hot and crowded. Cement keep (reproduction) is closed for demolition and reconstruction with wood. 
- Highlight then is the palace which is also a reconstruction (fire bombing), allegedly made to look like the original state with ornate gold panelling, hence why we went at all.
- Queue was too long so went to next best thing (garden) and had a look around. Overall a disappointing castle when we'd already seen Osaka. Same museum stuff like swords and stirrups etc but more limited. Grounds were grand.
- Taxi to Toyota museum. Noticed the extra front front mirrors. I had heard why they don't exist on export cars but don't remember. Need to re learn that. All taxis seem to have them.
- Toyota museum surprisingly interesting.
- Started as textile company that perfected the automatic loom and was mass producing that before moving into automobiles. Moved primarily due to large earthquake ruining tram lines and making automobiles popular.
- Learnt a lot about different textiles, both natural and synthetic. Polyster being like woll is stuck in my head and would come up next day at Universal.
- Great demonstration of the multi machine production line from raw cotton to tightly wound thread. Very strong when held close together, weak when far apart.
- Learnt how the loom works with waft and weave and just bashing it down. Realised that technological developments were just to make different steps quicker and easier.
- In the end, when Toyota mass producing, one woman could oversee 30-50 automatic looms.
- Interesting thing about Toyota as a car company was that they were determined to independently develop their cars without US partnerships which was unique in Japan. At least in part due to the knowledge that Japan needed small cars, not America size. Funny as small cars one of first things noticed here.
- Lots of cool car features that are retired like retractable bumper bar snd auto seatbelts. Made me think about all the crezy features that have been thought of but never made it through. The features in our modern cars are some subset of those that wriggled their way in.
- Raining now and walked to cute cafe. Pasta was too tomatoey as usual but very very cute place.
- Taxi back to accomodation area. Big book market down the road. Struck again by how calm Nagoya is and cozy. Most books in Japanese so not much good, even kid ones.
- Managed to get a German/English lettering book that I will use for RPG and girlfriend for tattoos.
- Made our way to station for Shinkansen. Super early due to mum's rushing. People wanted to sit and have a beer with our two hours so I councilled staying outside the station gates and looking for a place, warning that there probably won't be much once inside. People were anxious despite excess time and we had to spend a long time waiting in the stinky and hot waiting room, scrounging seats and beers.
- Finally get on Shinkansen, see a guy in my seats and slightly over confidently show him my ticket. He says "train name janaidesu, korewa other train name". I turn to everyone and just as I tell them the train starts moving.
- Its going to the same place and call my mum but they haven't made the same mistake. Hope no ticket inspectors come.
- Ride had lots of security passes but no checking of seats. Luckily not more busy.
- Getting to hotel was a struggle with too many directors and slow folk. 
- Passed a TeppenFrench place.
- Finally own room. Sleep so big.
