- Expansion based on mountains and rivers.

Very few navigable rivers in Japan due to tall mountainous terrain and narrow landmass. Rivers flow from mountain only a short distance before reaching the sea, hence they don't often combine to create wider courses. There are some which are found in the plains, of which one contains Tokyo. Navigable rivers are very important for economic growth and it is interesting that the basic geography of a region can play a large part in determining its future.
