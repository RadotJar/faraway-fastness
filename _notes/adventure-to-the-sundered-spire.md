title: Adventure to the Sundered Spire

Far to the west, where the deep desert meets the fiery Gartnait Alps and crosses over into the fertile lake basins, the Sundered Spire stands solitary. Once an active volcano that kept all the lands around it in flame and desolation, it now stands dormant and brooding. It is said that when the first Caliph united all the deserts under his great banner, he called upon the Shah of fire and the Shah of earth. Together they smote the spire, cleaving its peak clean off and causing it to collapse into itself. Rubble clad, the lands around returned to the desert, and the Caliph returned the peoples to their ancestral lands, such was his endless generosity and love for mankind.

Now, in the great walled cities of the 16th Caliph, word has been spreading that the Spire has been sundered anew. It is rumoured that the hollow lava caverns within house a flying machine of an ancient people, its hold laden with unclaimed spoils of a kind no living person could recognise or craft anew.

The rumours have piqued the interest of treasure hunters and scholars alike, but few save the mighty caravans of the Caliph would dare venture so far into the deep desert. In these dark times when the evil sorceress Isodor’s malice creeps ever further south and east, encroaching on the rim of the spire itself, truly only the foolhardy or desperate would heed these tales of lost lore and riches…

…Your party of foolhardy, desperate adventurers have heeded the tales of lost lore and riches and joined up with a mighty caravan headed West to trade with the Mizumi. Their lands lie across the shattered plains at the edge of the deep desert. The caravan has taken you as far as an oasis near the root of the Shattered Spire where it is to rest and do business for one week before continuing West. There is not to be another caravan passing through for many months. Will you make it big in time and escape to safer climes, or will your souls forever be lost in the endless desert?
