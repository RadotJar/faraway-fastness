## Peoples
### Tirenean
The empire-building Tireneans can be found throughout Caelera, though their greatest concentration remains in the Eastern and Western Obrulion Empires. They are tall-statured (men averaging 5‚Äô9‚Äù) with athletic body builds characterized by broad shoulders and narrow waists. They have long oval-shaped faces with upright foreheads, prominent cheekbones, narrow jaws, and moderately full lips. Tirenean eyes are deep-set and round, with coloration varying between blue-grey, grey, grey-brown, light brown, and dark brown. Their skin color is light but tans to dark brown. Tirenean hair is straight or wavy, and colored dark blonde, ash brown, dark brown, or black. The men have moderate beard and body hair.

Tireneans are proudly traditional about names, and take care to give every child a carefully-chosen Classical Obrulion name (although as fluency with Classical‚Äôs complexities has slipped away, many provincial Tireneans now carry vulgarized or hybridized versions of the old names). Moreover, while elsewhere in Caelera only the upper classes have surnames, in Tirenea even commoners possess hereditary family names (e.g. ‚ÄúSyrena Drakon‚Äù). Classically, it has often claimed that every Tirenean was descended from nobility, which may account for Tirenea‚Äôs name itself - ‚Äúland of crowns‚Äù. Perhaps because commoners have two names, nobles often claim a third name or cognomen based on some characteristic or accomplishment (e.g. ‚ÄúAudarius Valerian Tarkaun‚Äù).

**Male Names**: Obr√´us, Celictor, Destrio, Gundus, Omus, Quellus, Tavus, Valen, Zelicus

**Female Names**: Obr√´lyn, Celena, Dalefa, Hyaps√´, Istria, Nauriva, Riara, Syrena, Valanna, Zeodar√´

**Surnames**: Amadorus, Drakon, Hyatavi√´, Ionicus, Mennicus, Nuvicerres, S√ºromus, Tarcalus, Valerian

### Krysean
The stout and stoic Krysean people originally hailed from the rugged mountain range now known as "The Spine of Obrulion" which divides the Obrulion Empire into an East and a West. For over five hundred years their fate has been intertwined with that of the Obrulion Empire. Today Kryseans can be found anywhere the Empire is or has been, working as craftsmen, laborers, merchants, and soldiers. Kryseans are medium-statured (men averaging 5‚Äô8‚Äù), with athletic to stocky body builds characterized by compact bodies and short, sturdy limbs. They have oval-shaped faces with wide, slightly sloped foreheads and moderately full lips. Kryseans eyes are deep-set and round, with hazel, brown, and dark brown color. Their skin color ranges from light to medium brown, but tans to dark 
brown. Krysean hair is straight, wavy, or curly, and colored rufous brown, auburn, dark auburn, or brown-black. Their eyebrows tend 
to be thick and darker than their scalp hair. The men have heavy beard and body hair.

Kryseans are generally named in Classical Krysean after a favored ancestor, a mythic hero, or a close relative. Kryseans do not carry hereditary family names, instead indicating paternity simply by appending their father‚Äôs name after their own (e.g. Mandonio, the son of Terkinos, would be ‚ÄúMandonio Terkinos‚Äù). Kryseans who have left their homes may use a toponymic, formed by adding -tar 
or -atar to the name of their village, town, or city of origin (e.g. Nesca from Kavala may call herself ‚ÄúNesca Kavalatar‚Äù). Kryseans who are citizens of the Empire may take an Obrulion name, or may Obrulionize their existing one.

**Male Names**: Aibekeres, Bodilkas, Culchas, Hilerno, Indikortes, Mandonio, Pirreso, Sigilo, Terkinos, Uxentio

**Female Names**: Ausa, Chiomara, Daleninar, Ederata, Isbatara, Kara, Megara, Nesca, Sicounin, Unia

### Rornish
Once as barbaric as the Opplanders, the Rornish people were gradually subjugated and civilized by the Obrulion Empire as it expanded West across The Spine into the forrests and swamps of their homeland. Rornish folk can be found throughout the provinces of the Western and Eastern Obrulion Empires as craftsmen, soldiers, and servants. Recently many Rornish clans have been gathering back together in unsupervised parts of the Western Empire and rebelling in an attempt to reclaim their culture and lands. As the public opinion of the Rornish sours throughout the Western Empire, these people can find themselves facing racially motivated antagonism and unfair detainments. Rornish people are tall-statured (men averaging 5‚Äô10‚Äù) and athletically built, with broad shoulders and narrow waists. They have oval- or triangle-shaped faces with broad foreheads, narrow jaws, and moderately thin lips. Rornish eyes are round and deep-set, with coloration of blue, blue-grey, green-grey, green, hazel, or light brown. Their skin color ranges from fair and freckled to light brown. Rornish hair is straight or wavy, and colored golden blonde, strawberry, red, golden brown, rufous brown, auburn, or dark auburn. Their eyebrows tend to be thin and paler than their scalp hair. The men have moderate beard and body hair.

Rornish folk are typically named in the Ivorean language for a famous hero, ancestor, or relative. Rornish commoners do not carry hereditary family names. Men indicate paternity simply by appending their father‚Äôs name after their own (e.g. Owain, son of Stuarry, would be ‚ÄúOwain Stuarry‚Äù) while women indicate maternity by appending their mother‚Äôs name in a like fashion. However, Rornish nobles do carry hereditary family names; these are indicated by the identifier Ty followed by the name of their
noble house (e.g. Urien, of House Caradoc, would be ‚ÄúUrien Ty Caradoc‚Äù). Because Rorn has been a province of the Obrulion Empire for 
centuries, many Rornish people carry Obrulion or Obrulionized names (e.g. ‚ÄúUrienus Caradocian‚Äù), especially in the cities where the Obrulion influence was most strongly felt.

**Male Names**: Aeron, Braig, Caradoc, Georn, Mard, Owain, Roben, Stuarry, Theon, Urien

**Female Names**: Anwen, Ceridwen, Deiresa, Eirwen, Katrist, Maranie, Nimue, Rachess, Seren, Vale

### Dwarven
For as long as any man remembers, the stout and cunning dwarven people have delved vast vaults in the Gartnait Alps, gathering rich ores and 
creating enduring works of stone and iron. The occasional dwarven vault was delved in other mountain ranges too as the people expanded. Today, the dwarves are an embattled race, fighting a never-ending war against the fast-
breeding beastmen that have invaded their tunnels. Dwindling in number, barely clinging to their last ancestral holding, dwarves are 
rarely seen by mankind. Those that do mingle with men are almost always adventurers or refugees of some sort.

Dwarves are very short-statured (men averaging 4‚Äô) but exceptionally stout, weighing as much as adult humans, with broad shoulders and hips, thick-boned limbs, and sturdy digits. They have large, round heads with prominent brows and strong chins. Their eyes are large, round, and very deep set, colored either grey, grey-brown, green, hazel, or light brown. Their skin ranges from medium to very dark brown, ocher, or sienna. Their hair is wavy or curly, and colored chestnut, grey, or black. Both the men 
and women have heavy beard and body hair. 

The Dwarves are usually named in Old Dwarven for a close relative, famous ancestor, or vault hero. In addition to their given name, all 
dwarves carry a hereditary family name. Each dwarven vault will have a small number of surnames associated with the families of 
that vault. The vault itself is always named after its founder‚Äôs family. A vault founder‚Äôs surname carries great prestige among dwarves 
(e.g. a dwarf named Hurgon Radokh who hails from the vault of Azen Radokh is likely a person of some importance). In addition to 
their given name and surname, dwarves enjoy collecting sobriquets and nicknames; any dwarf of distinction will carry at least one and sometimes two or three.

**Male Names:** Arsic, Bombor, Denor, Hurgon, Korten, Morto, Norden, Stahlur, Torrad, Wharto

**Female Names:** Arsi, Balla, Dara, Efti, Fili, Klia, Lara, Mora, Shylda, Thora

**Surnames:** Breth, Domekh, Forkus, Gede, Karodar, Makor, Oengus, Radokh, Talorgen, Uoret
