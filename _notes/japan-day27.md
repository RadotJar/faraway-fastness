- Got up so early and didn't even eat and I was so worried about being hungry and grumpy and we found the train to Osaka.
- At Osaka, transferred to the Osaka-Umeda station. Finally got the hang of it crossing the raised bridge and signs were easy to follow. Unlike when it took us ages when staying in Osaka.
- Osaka loop line and then shoots off on multiple lines, one being to Universal Studios.
- Saw lots of people in hats and costumes even before this line. Little minion families.
- Entering the gates was a flood of people. Looked like a town, even the road manholes and fake shop names were American.
- Loads of merch shops selling the same stuff. Hats and cheap cookies and sweets and trinkets.
- Lots of cutesy outfits and Halloween ones for the evening. Matching friends and couples.
- Extremely busy but everyone respectful of lines and space etc.
- Rides are the main attraction but most have 90minute+ wait times.
- Themed areas. Open roam access to all except Nintendo World being the newest.
- Flying dinosaur best ride because so scary and loop de looping upside down etc.
- Even snack bars selling one thing had huge lines and didn't look particularly good.
- Not that many restaurant options and the food was very fast and mass produced by little factory cog in machine chefs but surprisingly not crazy expensive and quite tasty. Tables hard to get.
- Got selected by Olivander in front of a group of children and redid the wand scene
