- Not much of a breakfast, some origami folding.
- Went to coffee roastery. Good coffee but not the best. Also Hojicha latte and pocket croissant.
- Photo development place for quick film development and language barrier was quite high but we managed. 40 minute wait.
- Tocoro burger run by two young Japanese guys in this tiny town. Got there half an hour early but the guy who had learnt English in Australia came out and gave us stools and a menu to look at. One guy looked 15 and another early twenties but he was nearly 40.
- Girl came in and asked for su ko n ga arimasu ka.
- English music playing and they hosted live music events and left a band sticker which they shouted out on their story.
- Burgers were really good and looked small in photos but were big.
- Chips were wedges and Japan just calls both fried potato.
- Back to pick up bags and then picked up by van at train station by pink hair man to go to Onsen place.
- Very windy mountain road.
- Smelt like spices in the lobby, or some kind of incense. Lots of meek girls who seemed a little uncomfortable or under scrutiny or don't know what they're doing. 
- Manager sitting with businessmen and came over to see us and talk us through things, seems he could be overbearing.
- Little tatami rooms with no beds but a low table and little low chairs. Figured they put them out later.
- Other room had a little wooden tub and it was a bit "wow this is what the fuss and upgrade was about". Later tried it and read a book and looked out the window and maybe some people saw us naked.
- Got snacks before dinner so bought a lot at the family mart very close by. Huge beers.
- Dinner time we had our first banquet. Immediarely greeted by a number of women who lead you to the room and seat you and have another assigned one who takes all your orders and organises your times for cleaning and beds etc.
- She was Vietnamese and had limited English and apparently also limited Japanese but defaulted to talk to me maybe because we said we knew more Japanese or maybe because I have a penis. So nice and meek but hard to converse.
- Dinner was Sashimi, grill your own meats and veg on a little hot plate, Eel salad, other salad, crab and seafood custard thing. Non seafood lovers in group. Very expensive drinks.
- Watched monsters inc and stuck hat and moustache on tv for game. I cried a little when Sully had to say goodbye because it felt like such a fatherly movie.
