Today we arrived very late. We had to run from the escalator to our train going from the Airport to Shinagawa, but we managed to navigate the slightly confusing systems. Most unusual was the fact that you put two tickets into the gates at the same time. The tickets are different sizes and the orientation doesn't appear to matter, so I found myself marvelling at what internal mechanics must be handling the tickets.

Walking from the Shinagawa station to the guest house was a very pleasant experience. The city was so peaceful and there was a lovely cool breeze, nothing like the oppressive summer heat I'd read about on Reddit. Everything is so small and cute in Japan, cars, buildings and people alike.

At the guest house (TODO: name), we were greeted by the extremely welcoming staff who checked us in and gave us some recommendations for a ramen dinner. The common room was very small and sitting on the tiny stools with our huge rucksacks on was somewhat uncomfortable. 

Our room was also incredibly tiny, but clean and cozy. They'd managed to fit a double bed and a tiny desk in there but little else.

Using the amenities was my first real adventure. The bathroom was a 3-stage experience. A dry room with little stool to sit and undress, basin and other sundries. This was connected to a wet room which resembled a child's plastic playground module, fitted with a light, mirror, fan, shower etc. The third stage was the deep but narrow bath in this room. I couldn't figure out if I was meant to shower standing in the bath to avoid water getting on the plastic floor or if this was ok, but I opted to play it safe. Something didn't feel quite right about standing in a bath with the shower head mounted on the wall some distance away, angled so that it arced into me, hitting about chest level. With much ducking and weaving I managed to clean the day's travel sweat and grime off me and head for a poo.

Following a theme, the toilets were built for ants. Stepping into the cubicle, there was scarcely room to perform the about turn required to squat down onto the warm seat. Even then, I had to mega man spread with my knees pushed up against the toilet door, being a rather tall fellow. The toilet cistern was fitted with a tap which ran automatically upon flushing. Not knowing this, I had left my bundle of dirty clothes and a towel in the cistern basin and by the time I was finished, the bundle was thouroughly sodden. I am yet to try the bidet for fear that fecal particles may be propelled onto the back of my ballsack.

The part of Shinagawa we were staying in is very old. The streets are beautiful with little decorated lanterns built into the street poles (rather than being mounted overhead as I'm used to). We picked a ramen place that we were recommended called Kimi Ramen and went inside. By this point it was nearly 10pm, but luckily some of these places are open until midnight or 1am. To order, you buy a meal ticket from a vending machine and then pass that to the staff. It was at this moment we realised we didn't have internet and the ticket machine was only in Japanese. With embarassed looks at eachother, we picked two random options, and there were a **lot** of options.

When the food came out, the chef grinned at us knowingly and just said "biiiiiiig". Luckily only one bowl was the big size but it was humongous. I ate my smaller bowl and then had to help my girlfriend eat most of her huge one. Even then we couldn't finish it all. The ramen was the best I've had, maybe unsurprisingly. It was absolutely packed with minced garlic and contained extremely tender pork.

During the meal we discussed the options on the ticket machine and were able to decipher „Çâ„Éº„ÇÅ„Çì„ÄÄ(ramen). Then I realised that when we chose Â§ß and ‰∏≠, it must have meant big and medium in terms of serving size. I knew ‰∏≠„ÄÄas "naka", meaning middle or inside, and Â§ß as "da" in chinese, meaning big. 

After the meal, I plucked up the courage to ask the chef "„Åì„ÅÆ„Çâ„Éº„ÇÅ„Çì„Çè„Åä„Åä„Åç„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô„Å≠Ôºü" (This ramen is big isn't it?). He replied "„ÅØ„ÅÑ" (yes), but gave me a somewhat confused look. I continued, "„Å®„Åù„ÅÆ„Çâ„Éº„ÇÅ„Çì„Çè„Å™„Çì„Åß„Åô„ÅãÔºü" (and what is that ramen?). And so it went, with him even going so far as to write out the portion sizes for me (360g and 240g for those interested), before finally getting to the answer I wanted. For meal sizes, ‰∏≠ (medium), is pronounced "chu". Â§ß„ÄÄ(large), is pronounced "ookii".

The way the staff's faces lit up when I tried to speak Japanese was so worth it, and I think we went from stupid foreigners to slightly nicer foreigners in their eyes. I feel much more confident in myself than the last time I travelled, and I'm going to try really hard to speak Japanese as much as I can on this trip.

Heute sind wir sehr sp√§t gekommen. Wir sind von die Rolltreppe zum Zug gelauft. Die Systeme war Komplex, aber haben wir sie verstanden. Mann muss im Bahnhofstor zwei Zugfahrkarten setzen. Es war der ungew√∂hnlichste Ding. Die Zugfahrkarten sind verschiedene Gr√∂√üen und die Orientierung ist nicht wichtig. Ich habe die Mechanismen gestaunt.
