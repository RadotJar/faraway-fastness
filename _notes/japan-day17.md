## English (WIP)
- Breakfast at expensive seeming pancake place at the bottom of a hotel. Banana and chocolate pancake and also benedicy pancake. Very good english, english bigger than the Japanese on menu and all white people. Read together.
- Back to hotel, read a bit more in the kitchen. Collected everyone from their expensive white people cafe for a hike.
- Slow start walking through shopping areas. Blocked by shrines and shopping. Bought rice spoon. Mum reminisced about childhood toys and Ramune. Cool wood carvings of long guys who are goblins or wizards.
- Temples hike was quite slow as a big group, constantly stopping for photos. Thing about the first lord dying and second lord building temple. Woman instagram photo in front of cemetery.
- We couldn't find any good open lunch places, went to food stalls food tent and had donuts and apple. Stalls all closing and people falling asleep, hot food in the sun etc. Very different from day before.

- Clever cash register and got print coasters.
