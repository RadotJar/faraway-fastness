- Super uneccesarily early wake up after long universal studios day.
- Bus to seemingly random suburban street and slowly crowds grew, wondered why. Later found out that famous temple at the end.
- Stopped at a little coffee and donut shop that had good coffee. Overwhelmed them with the 7 of us.
- Crowds grew and grew as we crawled up this shopping street filled with souvenirs and treats etc.
- I'd read that Kyoto was someone's lowlight because of over-tourism and I could definitely see that already.
- Got to temple. All orange with intricate colourful painting that hadn't seen on any other temples before. I wonder what this signifies, maybe just a grand temple.
- Crowds continued to swell as we saw the nice main building with gold work and beautiful timbers but it was becoming hard to enjoy.
- Temple also had sort of portcullises or metal grates that could be swung closed over openings. For defence or something else?
- Busy bus stop wait to get to Ikari gates/shrine.
- Thought that it was interesting that back when people walked around they probably used temples as landmarks. Now bus stops are at these same temples and castles. Transportstion may have changed but the important landmarks remain the same.
- Skipped a whole section to avoid the crowds and even then it was still insanely busy.
- Gates were cool but after a few runs through groups of them, you've seen it. 
- Wonder the meaning of all the gates. Something about passing through reincarnations or stages of life?
- Speed hiked up to the top and it was not worth it. No view, but another place of worship similar to the ones dotted around the mountainside. Only worth it for the feeling of accomplishment itself.
- Nice Izakaya type place for dinner owned by a seemingly young woman with her own Okinominyaki recipe. Had kimchi and pork yakisoba on the table grill.
