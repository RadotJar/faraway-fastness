ðŸŒ±

I've been doing some reading in the last couple of weeks about 'Digital Gardening'.

I've taken this concept to mean cultivating a unique little space on the web to collect and develop your thoughts. 

This space is constantly growing, never perfect and always open to the scrutiny of other web-goers. 

It is in opposition to the modern 'stream' model of web platforms, aiming to create a longer lasting, more interconnected, more beautiful web.

Key ideas include 'learning in public' and '[the stream vs the garden](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)'.

I want to thank [this great site](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) for providing the template on which the faraway fastness is built.
