The pages of this site contain one of three icons in their titles. These icons represent how well developed the pages are.

🛖 **Outpost** - This page contains a new thought. Something I've probably touched once, and am still chewing on. Like a little speck of civilization in the vast unknown, a seed for great things to come.

⛪ **Settlement** - This page contains a thought I've come back to a few times. It is probably linked to a handful of other pages. Like a growing hub of humanity, drawing in connections with its warmth and life.

🏰 **Fastness** - This page contains a well developed though, something I'm proud of. I've probably iterated on it many times and have linked it to many other pages. Like a solid fortress on a hill, something the locals are proud of, something that travelers gaze upon in awe.
