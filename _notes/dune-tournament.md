title: Dune Tournament
---

I am hosting a tournament for the [Dune Boardgame](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/283355/dune)!

Players will be divided into groups of 6 and play two games with the same group:

1. The first game will be a practice game played using the basic rules
2. The second game will be a real game played using the advanced rules

Factions will be randomly assigned in the practice game.

The winner(s) of the practice game will have the advantage of choosing their faction for the real game.
Aside from this, the result of the practice game does not have any impact on the tournament.

The winner(s) of the real games will progress to the second round of the tournament.

The losers of the real games will be reshuffled into new groups of 6 to play another real game.
The winner(s) of these "loser" games will progress to the second round and the pattern will continue until all places are filled in the games of the second round.
I call this tournament style "the squabbles of the peasantry".

I don't know how many rounds we will need to play to establish a final winner.

The winner will receive the much coveted artisan crafted lino-printed t-shirt, by yours truly.
There will also be a wooden spoon prize.
