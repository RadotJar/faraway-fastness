title: Dune Tournament
---

I am hosting a tournament for the [Dune Boardgame](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/283355/dune)!

Players will be divided into groups of 6 and play two games with the same group:

1. The first game will be a practice game played using the basic rules
2. The second game will be a real game played using the advanced rules

Factions will be randomly assigned in the practice game.

The winner(s) of the practice game will have the advantage of choosing their faction for the real game.
Aside from this, the result of the practice game does not have any impact on the tournament.

The winner(s) of the real games will progress to the final.

If all the real games have been completed, but not enough winners have progressed to the final, the 6 player pools will be shuffled and more games played until the final is full.

The winner will receive the much coveted, artisan, bespoke, hand-crafted, one of a kind, lino-printed t-shirt, by yours truly.
There will also be a wooden spoon prize.
