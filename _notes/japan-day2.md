This is the second day of our trip. You can find [[japan-day1|the first day]] here and the [[japan-day3|third day]] here.

This morning we rose early and checked out of our tiny accomodation with some breakfast recommendations from the hosts. We decided to walk along the river to a nice pastry shop. Both of the breakfast recommendations we received were pastry shops, so I assumed this was a popular breakfast for the Japanese.

We ordered a pancake, eggs, bacon and lettuce (strange addition) meal and some drinks. While those were getting prepared we were able to fill up a tray of pastries and bread. The food was all very pretty and the coffee surprisingly tasty. I'd been led to believe Australians are coffee snobs and that coffee wasn't as good elsewhere, but it seems this isn't the case in Japan. This place was right on the river and clearly catered to an upper class, but I'd go again if there weren't so many other places to try.

After breakfast we walked back to the train station with some hurry to board the Shinkansen to Hiroshima. I'd bought the tickets online the night before as there are only three train cars with unreserved seats, the other 13 requiring ticket purchase ahead of time.

- Shinkansen. Seeing all of Japan go past and man in front didnt care
- Wrong mailbox when finding accomodation
- Tiny place and funny plastic bathroom. Just exactly enough stuff for two people except forks and spoons. A view and balcony
- Went to 7/11. Giant cans of alcohol next to soda. Got some snacks
- Got lost in the gisnt shopping area. Very hungry and overwhelmed. Department store of 8 floors with coffee shop, books, toys, homewares, electronics
- Dinner at Izakaya and old man watched us the whole time but was very happy at the end when we said oishii
- Called into bar with sign. Spoke to Tokyo man who was friendly and wished we had spent more time. Asked about cinema, no luck. Asked about dessert. Muzukashii Australians. 31 years old but looked 20
- Ice cream place and early grey nice. Had to eat it standing up because heard its rude to walk
- Washed clothes in sink
