- Little local market that happens every day, pretty crazy. Town has permanent shade areas for stalls and the stallholders rotate location every day. About 20 stalls down by the river, misty mountains in the background.
- Lots of fruits: Apples, Grapes etc. Preserves, veggies, honey and jewelery made of paper (check name).
- Seemed more for the locals to get fresh produce but that was nice, not a lot of option for us as tourists.
- Lavish Japanese breakfast.
- Town had a very "abandoned ski village", kind of like Daisen. Heat and sun was intense this time of day. Really loved the buildings backed onto dense forest.
- Walked along river to only coffee shop in town. Large american feeling lodge with wooden interior nestled into the forest edge. Little ornaments scattered in the foliage.
- Run by old couple. Lots of coffee options and pancakes!! Reminisced about our favourite food and accomodation, both in Shikoku.
- Tried to ask for strong coffee or extra shot but she didn't understand. Said "„Åä„ÇÇ„ÅÑ" and she seemed to get it but said she can't do that. People have said that before and I realised its probably because they use drip coffee.
- Walked back along river and took the time to enter riverbed and dip our feet in little rock pools. Threw a driftwood log into the rapids and it drifted downstream. Had fun chasing it and getting it unstuck to continue its journey. 
- Tried finding crabs and found an old rusty hunk of metal that would have attached two things together. 
- Lots of stray "rheo" blocks between two bridges. Wondered if there once had been another structure but told probably just for erosion.
- Felt very nice like being a kid again and just following your curiosity.
- Tried the local footbath near the markets which was full of dead skin floating around and not very pleasant. Also very hot.
- Snacks including tuna roll from conbini.
- Back to room to chill out for a short time before dinner again.
- Dinner highlights included salt encrusted fish on skewers, a seafood hot pot and a little heated broth for cooking own meat. 
- Walked to other hotel and got picked up for starry night tour. Vietnamese waitress ran up to us and brought the metallic mats we had wondered about and tickets as well. Very sweet of her and probably not getting paid enough. We wondered at the working conditions.
- Short bus ride to gondola station. Atrange animal cages weren't sure to leave animals or bring on the ride.
- Ride surprised us, took about 15 minutes and had incredibly steep sections. Dark and spooky, weird alien theme.
- Ushered to the stage by lightsaber wielding adults and rolled out our mat under the cloudy sky.
- Countdown before they shut off the huge floodlights dramatically and could see one star or three if you squinted.
- Guy gave a talk
