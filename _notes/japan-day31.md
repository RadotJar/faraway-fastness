- Woke to get a clear view out to Fuji. Had some green tea on the balcony and enjoyed the sunshine.
- Left our bags and rode across the bridge to the other side of lake Kawaguchi. Didn't really appreciate the view as I was grinding up the hill but the way down was so fast and fun. Loads of tourists from all the resorts ringing the lake were riding around.
- Breakfast a cute little cafe called Cafe Tino. Very friendly and very tasty affordable food. Had an ultimate sando that was stacked with ingredients and choco banana pancake. Really friendly staff too.
- Lovely riding around the little suburban streets.
- Crossed bridge again. Great view of the lake especially tiny little island with a shrine. Little more than a clump of reeds. Wooden shrine must go under at low tides.
- Visited music forrest museum seen [[japan-day30|the day prior]]. 
- European appearing cluster of buildings dedciated to automotons and automatic music machines.
- Hall with music machines. So few made and at such prices they were just for rich people to show off. 
- China cabinet with 7x 30 second songs on embossed metal discs.
- Women in fancy red blazers got out cranks to play ones that you want to see.
- Upstairs had automatons that looked older than they were, actually from the 90s.
