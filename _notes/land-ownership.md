title: Land Ownership
---


Everyone in Australia is obsessed with owning property (land). The boomers had it cheap and have made a killing, the young people all want it to secure their financial future. It is basically in the Australian culture now to complain about housing prices.

I pose a question: Is land ownership really that important?

As far as I understand, other countries with higher population densities and stronger economies don't *expect* to own property like we do. They live and generate wealth like the rest of us, so why are we so obsessed?

I'd like to read more about this topic, particularly with a historical focus. For a lot of human history, the average person did not own land, that was a priviledge for the minority elite. What changed?
