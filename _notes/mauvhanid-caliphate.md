The Mauvhani are ruled over by a Caliph or god-king, who resides in the holy city. 
Rather than an all powerful creator god, they believe that a lesser god created the world unintentionally, trapping itself in the process. 
In their religion, the Caliph is the current incarnation of this god. He is to be appeased, but does not hold any real power. 
For this, the Mauvhani turn to the immortal Shah (singular and plural).

It is said that when a hero or saint dies, they ascend to godhood, and watch over the world.
When these figures are still in living memory, they are often venerated and petitioned as individuals.
When they pass out of living memory, they are remembered as one of many.
Thus, the war hero Alishar bar Munaazar will eventually become one of the immortal Shah of battle.

It is the practice of Theurges to intercede with the immortal Shah, asking them for miracles and protection and in turn enacting their will on the world.
