The Mauvhani are ruled over by a Caliph or god-king, who resides in the holy city. 
Rather than an all powerful creator god, they believe that a lesser god created the world unintentionally, trapping itself in the process. 
In their religion, the Caliph is the current incarnation of this god. He is to be appeased, but does not hold any real power. 
For divine intervention, the Mauvhani turn to the immortal Shah (singular and plural).

It is said that when a hero or saint dies, they ascend to godhood, and watch over the world.
When these figures are still in living memory, they are often venerated and petitioned as individuals.
When they pass out of living memory, they become one with the powers they champion.
Thus, the war hero "Alishar bar Munaazar the defender of Nazub" will eventually become one of the immortal Shah of battle.

It is the practice of Theurges to intercede with the immortal Shah, asking them for miracles and protection and in turn enacting their will on the world.

The Mauvhani see wizardry in the studious sense as sacreligious. An unwelcome interference in the natural order which the Shah so carefully balance.
Studying and practitioning magic outside of religious instruction is outlawed throughout the Caliphate. Those who are caught are pursued and punished by disciplinary orders and typical believers alike.
For this reason, the wizards who do exist within the borders of the Caliphate are forced to live on the fringes, and keep their secrets tightly held.
Remote wizard towers for master and apprentice only are to be found through the deserts and badlands, and no towers of knowledge exist within the walls of the great walled cities.
