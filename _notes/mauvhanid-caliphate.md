The Mauvhani are rules over by a Caliph or god-king, who resides in the holy city. 
Rather than an all powerful creator god, they believe that a lesser god created the world unintentionally, trapping itself in the process. 
In their religion, the Caliph is the current incarnation of this god. 
He is to be appeased, but does not hold any real power. 
For this, the Mauvhani turn to the immortal Lords and Ladies.

It is said that when a hero or saint dies, they ascend to godhood, and watch over the world and the descendants they leave behind.
