This morning we took a short walk to a local Okonomiyaki shop for a hearty breakfast before our big day of sightseeing in Hiroshima. The shop was a cute little corner store with a very nice woman doing the front of house work. She told us "„Å°„Çá„Å®„Åæ„Å¶" (wait a moment) and we waited until enough space was free at the counter seats. Interestingly, even though solo diners were lining up behind us and there was enough space for them while we waited for two seats to be free, they were not seated until we were. I'm not sure if this is a cultural thing or if there was some other strategy going on.

The Okonomiyaki we ate is a specialty of Hiroshima, just called "Hiroshimayaki" I later found out. Sitting at the counter, we could watch the chefs cooking the meal in some detail on the massive hot plate that was ringes by counter seats. The chefs cooked using two large spatula-like tools, kind of giant metal levers I suppose. The Hiroshimayaki consists of a tortilla-like base, topped with a lot of shredded cabbage, strips of bacon, various sauces, a fried egg, chicken (maybe) and probably other things I missed. Your choice of noodles are fried separately (udon or soba), and the growing tower of ingredients is flipped onto the noodles to form the final large, round dish. I got udon noodles and my girlfriend got soba. Soba was the recommended choice and I must say that the thinner style of noodle added a lovely crunch that the thick udon couldn't match. The servings are also incredibly generous and I had to help my girlfriend finish hers before we headed out for our sightseeing.

Our first stop was an art museum. I generally don't like art museums and that feeling was reinforced here. There were four large, blank rooms with about 10 paintings each by famous European artists including Picasso. Need I say more. The basement contained a nice collection of Japanese art. These were of the classic ink on silk scrolls you might imagine, but I noticed that most of the mediums listed "India ink and Japanese colour on silk". I didn't realise that trade with India probably had a large impact on Japanese art. 

The walk from the art museum to the all important Hiroshima bomb dome and associated museum was quite long across the very glarey city scape. The sun was very hot and the weather this time of year quite humid. Needless to say, we required a pit stop along the way and were searching for a place to get a drink before we stumbled on a cat cafe.

The cat cafe was an odd experience. You pay a flat fee for the first 30 minutes of being there, with an extra cost for every 10 thereafter. Drinks are in addition to that price. This is a bit of an odd business model if you ask me as it seems to encourage people to leave as soon as they can. I suppose it is hard to charge cat time any other way though. The cafe was set up as a maze of little booths that the cats climbed over and between, with additional climbing spaces for them up the walls. Toys are also provided and for an additional charge you could buy the cats "Cat Lattes". These looked to me like some strange jelly that you fed them with a spoon, but it seemed the only way to really get their attention. I think they are so used to people that they are fairly uninterested, and more than the regular uninterestedness of their species.
