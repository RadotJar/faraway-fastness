## English (WIP)
- Woke up late, cooked some eggs with tha soy sauce and oyster stuff. 
- Mum was already out and bought her bush knife.
- Walked down to the bush knife place. Really cool damascus, ceramic knives looked like magic items. All sizes.
- Street was packed with so many knife stalls you didn't even know what to get. Super hot. Train came through the crowd. 
- Went to the cutlery hall and got our nice kitchen knives. Really cool "asymettrical" ones .
- Saw sword smithing museum. Learnt about the multi person smithing, folding the steel. All the different crafts involved in sword making: sword, handle, guard, sharpening, sheath. Iron purification or selection steps.
- Samurai dress up. Cool to see how all the armor was attached. Greaves, arms, skirt, cuirass, helmet, wrap around, sword. Also glaive and bow, mum was leading in red.
