title: Bikeable cities

- Are walkable.
- People in Australia need infrastructure but people in Japan bike regardless of poor infrastructure. Is it because density forces it?
- Japanese even have double baby bikes, use them like cars when cars are difficult to store and use.

Everyone is walking around on their damn phone! While phone addiction is a separate issue, I've noticed a modern phenomenon while walking and transiting around my city. People are glued to their phones no matter what they're doing, even while walking. To an extent, being on one's phone on a bus or a train can be somewhat excused. You're in an environment with not much going on and want something to do. You're just trying to get from A to B, not to experience the environment. Not only is ambulated phone use dangerous, I just feel there's something inhuman and wrong about it. You're in a bustling city, there's so much to see, so many interesting people to observe and meet. The city is meant to be a place of life that you want to experience while you're there...only you don't...

I wonder if the phone addiction epidemic is worsened by our poorly designed cities that cater to cars rather than people. Why would anyone want to look up from their phone if all they're surrounded by is concrete, bitumen and other phone zombies? If the environment is unpleasant and uninteresting, the phone is a safe retreat and we are all the worse for it.
