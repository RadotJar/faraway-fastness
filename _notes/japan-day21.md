- Eggs and cake and packed.
- Reading on the balcony.
- Host took us to train station, missed first one. Then to hardware to look for artwork protector. His Japanese was worse than I would have thought for 30 years, didn't even know "cut". Later found out it was an unspoken rule to speak English at home because plenty of Japanese sources for his kids.
- Ended up with light plastic tubing, cut to size.
- Back to station and on fake food train. Hamburger handhold, eggplant, spring onions falling out of bowl. 
- Confirmed ticket before and pay after in cash system. Driver very accomodating and got us change using his own wallet.
- Another traina and then another. Semi-rapid but not all stops so had to get off at end of that one and board another rest of way. Lesson to check destination.
- Wondered about Kanji and literacy given kanji was also written in Hiragana on station boards.
- Beef jerky was pretty good. Choc chip melon bread was really nice. Not melon at all, maybe shape.
- Finally got to Nakatsugawa and walked to fancy seeming accomodation. 
- Dinner at "Genuine Izakaya Diner" which was already a red flag and options seemed limited but happy hour 200yen beers and 100 yen high balls.
- Inside, beers more like 690yen and food really expensive and limited, fishy menu. Surprisingly tasty and my attitude changed. Did have good foot crevice seating. Salmon and cheese surprised me. Tried horse sashimi and tasted like any old meat, haven't had raw cow before to be fair. Most expensive meal so far. Got good at saying Hai and passing food to correct people.
- Happy and few drinks in, went looking for a bar. Found "Queen" bar which had picture of a side profile of a woman's face and some set thing for 3300yen. Sent sister and partner up to check, Shed heard them talking loudly so we went to check on them. Peered around staircase and saw Thai looking people and them who said it was good to go up. Called the troops in.
- Beers for 500yen. Slowly snacks and karaoke came out and chatty hosts. Slowly explained our family including Lesbians which didn't phase them.
- Japanese guy at bar. Initially thought he was a friend if owners. Came up to me with his phone, showed photo of guys in latex undies and bondage ties around cock, then shirtless men in a bar. Sat down but thought he might be warning us about the place so went to ask him if it was here by saying "Kanojo to Kanojo". He said not here, in Kyushu. Showed me again and grabbed penis and did the little thumb between fingers meaning small penis I think. Confused, sat back down. Later he came over to the group and did the same but then also showed a chef displaying a big hunk of Wagyu on a platter, I think asked if I wanted to eat it. Family thought he said sushi and said "oh yeah, oishii sushi". I said "wakarimasen" and he went back. Later when deacribed girlfriend he left bar. 
- Found out it was a set price of 3300yen per hour and for half hour we paid half plus our drinks so very expensive. Our fault for not reading but felt ripped off a bit.
- Back to accomodation for tea and funny origami penis and box and debrief.
- Later, showering. Tiny towel and saved with big towel delivery while naked behind curtain. 
- Thought that toilet slippers are clever "someone is here" indicator of you want poo privacy or something.
