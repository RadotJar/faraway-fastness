- Eggs for breaky. Out to knife festival for another look. Got wildlife flip knife. Lucca knife for parents.
- Walked to train. Very cute old style tiny red train. Ticket guys waiting at the station in the sun in their nice clothes and polished shoes and hats and little coin bowl. Train had lots of art and very unique seats.
- Mino looked like tiniest town yet with clearly visible urinal from station.
- Cute little family deli had cheese and pork stick, potato, ham croquette, katsu sandwiches.
- Washi prints, cat mug, lots of lanterns including minecraft and maybe pokemon.
