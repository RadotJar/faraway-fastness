## English (WIP)
- Oldies went out for an early breakfast and came back noisily to us still sleeping.
- Mum went to Tower Knives.
- We went to the same breakfast place. Nyan cat music with free nail and hair styling for staff? Very tasty mince rice bowl.
- Train to Osaka castle. 
- Castle grounds were lush and natural looking, dense and dark green.
- Castle was two moated with the green leafy bit in the moat.
- Donjon was majestic, lovely blue tiles that I think were painted or infused ceramic rather than the bronze shingles of nearby temple which dripped green onto the cement. Gold accents.
- Museum within was dissapponting. A lot of people again, lots of information in classic exhibit style. Lots of repeated and similar information about the Summer Wars and "this thing is impressive". Armor was cool to see, cery beautiful colours aswell as family crests. Simple and probably effective but compared to western garish colours maybe not?
- Mum told me about Portugese introducing guns and famous sword smiths switching to gun barrels. 
- Lots about important people in the wars but too much content and a lot of name and date spamming.
- Videos were a loud cacophany in one room, should be headphones. Art style of hologram was cool.
- Wish there was more on strategic reasons for the castle.
- Cool to learn that it was rebuilt by the Tokugawas after destroying the existing one in great fire.
- Rainy view from top was magnificent.
- Dinner we split up into Izakaya and Ramen groups. Had oishii Yakitori including the chicken wrapped in leaves and with plum sauce. Also beer and fruit wines.
- Got some snacks and back to bed.
