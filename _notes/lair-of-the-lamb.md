## Advice for Players

- You will spend more time choosing and planning
battles than fighting. Running away is often the right
choice. The most reliable ways to kill a monster don't
rely on attack rolls.
- Social skills will make your life easier, but reaction rolls won't do you any good in this adventure where most creatures already have a preordained reaction to you. 
To be effective you must learn what creatures want (usually by just asking them).
- There are over a dozen secret doors and hidden
treasures in this adventure. They range from the
obvious to the cryptic. None of these are essential, but
they all improve your odds of survival. 
- Information is the fuel that powers your exploits. It is
a resource that you spend to find secrets, solve
puzzles, and sidestep combats. To acquire more
information, you must ask more questions about your
environment. Try to ask a question in every room.
- Many of the puzzles are solved by recognizing patterns
and/or using mundane objects in clever ways. Many
puzzles have 3 or more solutions. A shocking amount
of problems can be solved with enough rope.
- The rooms in this dungeon are tightly interlinked, and
are designed to work in harmony with each other.
This includes backtracking, looping, and mapping.
Sometimes the solution to a puzzle or a combat can be
found in a later room. Encounters are not always best
handled in the room where they occur.
- Time is the enemy. Your torches are burning down.
You have no food and no water. Every hour brings with the risk of a Random Encounter. And yet,
your survival requires you to take the time to
investigate all the suspicious phenomena. You must
learn to balance these competing needs if you wish to
be good at dungeoncrawling.
