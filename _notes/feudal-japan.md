title: Feudal Japan

ðŸŒ±

Needless to say, my travels in Japan have inspired me to learn about the Japanese Feudal system. 

In Hiroshima I learnt about the way in which land was given to daimyo based on expected rice production, rather than area. I think this makes sense in a mountainous region where a lot of land by area is not neccesarily land suited to farming. I should look into whether this is a reasonable theory by researching what other places did with similar and different terrain.

Today I learnt that the villagers of Shirakawa-go secretly produced gunpowder under their house to give to the warrior monks when the need arose. There was a period of Japanese history where these monks were in constant conflicts with the ruling lords and samurai. 

There was a period when Spanish and Portuguese came to Japan to spread Christianity. The Western Japanese power allied with these imperial groups fought against the Tokugawa Shogunate. Tokugawa was warned by the Dutch that colonisation would come shortly after Christianity and so he allied with his old enemies in the buddhist warrior monks and fought the Spanish and Portugese out of Japan. Following this was the Edo period, and isolation apart from trade with the Dutch and China.
