### üìñ Rule Clarifications

**Armour Removal:** It takes 1 full round action (movement and attack action) to doff 1 AC worth of armour. E.g. It takes 6 rounds of doing nothing but removing armour to fully remove a suit of plate armour.

**Opening Doors in Combat:** Opening a door is a movement action. I.e. you can do it instead of moving OR instead of attacking.

**Lockpicking in Darkness:** A thief can lockpick in complete darkness due to their **shadowy senses** ability.

**Shadowy senses when in Light:** Shadowy senses functions as long as a thief is in darkness or dim light. If a thief is in bright light, they cannot use their shadowy senses.

### üìñ Rule Clarifications

**Spell Declaration** You must declare you are casting a spell before initiative is rolled. You must specify which spell.

**Flanking:** Flanking an enemy gives you a +2 to hit.

**Attacking from Rear:** Attacking an enemy from the rear gives you a +2 to hit like flanking. If your character can ambush or backstab, you may also trigger those abilities.

**Firing into Melee:** Firing through engaged allies to hit an unengaged opponent is at -2. Firing at opponents engaged with allies is not allowed at all (unless you have the Precise Shooting proficiency, which is at -4).

**Retreating from Melee:** You must declare your retreat before initiative is rolled. On your initiative, you turn away from engaged enemies and move up to your running speed. You have -2 AC until your next turn. Opponents **do not** get a free attack a la 'opportunity attack'.

**Ammunition Retrieval:** Spent ammunition cannot be retrieved.
