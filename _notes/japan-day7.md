## English
- Breakfast at FBI cafe. Opened just for us. Listening to country and reggae music. Surreal experience as the only ones in the park. Felt like abandoned american camp or movie set. Good burgers, presented so pretty. Read our books
- Continued reading on balcony
- National park. Got map from visitor centre. Walked up stone rosd through Daisen town.
- Took the natural stone path up to the temple, so slippery.  
- Very majestic view through reverse gate up stairs to temple.
- Continued through lush forest. Felt like fairy land. So much less touristy. Local guy told us to keep going up the path we were on. Reminded Lucca of NSW. 
- Lunch at Dam. Foggy mountaintop not good view.
- Back down to get first purchase of souvenirs. 1999 block prints by mountain man and mushroom pin.
- Drove into Yonago. First paid parking experience, 100 yen an hour.
- Tiny seats in tiny cafe and tiny waitress half our height. Swearing rap juxtaposed to morning music.
- Not a touristy town, more looks than usual. 
- Walked to old castle ruins. Guy died with no heir. Not very well maintained, only people coming down.
- Amazing views out across the peninsula ans over the city. Watched the orange sun sink below the islands and clouds. So many crows.
- Nice man with little dog said cool tshirts. I asked him about dinner and he told us about izakaya street near train station. Decided to walk with us and his little dog was called Hana something and kept turning around to see us snd had a little light.
- Picked a place, had qr code for english menu. Was broken and couldn't order through it. Translation app called Link and we wrote our orders. Oishii but I was quite stressed out and felt bad for making it so hard.
