## English

- Left from Daisen. Couldn't find any breakfast places nearby.
- Drove a long way to cute open garden cafe in middle of nowhere run by old DIY couple. Extremely cute and lovely.
- Fuel for first time, difficult getting correct type, done for us. Saluted.
- Udon chain restaurant in a huge carpark town.
- Arrived in accomodation. Greeted with tea and apple cake.
- Very good English, spoke for a long time. Showed my book due to her language learning history.
- Later walked to KuShiYa. Best meal so far. Lovely family restaurant with shoes off and sunken floor. Amazing Karaage. Got asked so many questions and little kids saying bye.
- On walk home, young Japanese couple walked past, gave fistbump and I swear he said Eshay
