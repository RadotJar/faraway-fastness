Here are some things I like about Torchbearer. Aspects of the game I find unique and interesting and would steal and try to use in other games.

## The Grind
In Torchbearer, characters accumulate negative conditions. These conditions are: 'Hungry and Thirsty', 'Angry', 'Afraid', 'Exhaused', 'Injured', 'Sick' and eventually 'Dead'.
Conditions can be earned as a consequence of failed rolls, but they can also be earned simply through the passing of time.
Every four turns, all characters earn the next condition in a pre-determined order. This is called 'The Grind'. Note: A turn passes when any character makes a roll.

3. Explicit phases of play
4. Narrative pacing built into mechanics
