## Open Table Policy
New players are always welcome at any session without prior warning or preparation. I will have a few pre-gens ready at all times in case someone new wants to give the game a try. Please feel free to bring anyone along who you think might be interested.

## Before Your First Game
If you've played in one of my campaigns before, I expect you to do the following before your first game:
- Read this guide.
- Read the setting primer.
- Create a character. Session time is sacred and only for playing the game, not character creation.

## Character Creation
The procedure for character creation can be found on page 13 of the ACKS II Revised Rulebook. A PDF of this rulebook can be found pinned in the discord. All classes from this rulebook, as well as those found in the dwarven supplement 'By This Axe', and the work-in-progress elven class document can be chosen for your character.

You can follow this procedure to make a character in your own time, but you'll need to run them past me before they can be played at the table. Whether you want to work with me to flesh out a character concept first and then build the character afterwards, or build them first and then come to me for a final check is up to you. I am also more than happy to sit down online or in person and build them together, but this must be arranged ahead of a session. A good option is for you to arrive at 6pm before a session to give us time to create a character together before play.

## Game Schedule
- Games will be run at my house every Friday at 6:30pm.
- At 6:30pm, we will eat pizza and catch up.
- At 7:00pm, the game starts.
- If you are going to be late and have told me in advance, I will wait up until 7:15pm to start the game.
- If you are going to be late and have not told me, I will be starting at 7:00pm.
- If you are going to be later than 7:30pm, do not attend. It is too disruptive. Just play next time instead.
- There will be an attendance poll for each session in the discord. On Thursday evenings I will check the poll. If at least 3 players have said they are attending, the game will go ahead the following day.

## Game Expectations
- Let others shine.
- Work as a team.
- Be inquisitive.
- Be punctual.
- Don't come if you're not in the mood.
- Don't be disruptive and bring a fidget toy if you need one!

## Bonus XP
I will award bonus XP for the following out of game activities:
- 5% Bonus XP if you bring snacks or drinks
- 5% Bonus XP in your next session if you write a short session summary (200 words or less).
