## Play Schedule
- Games at my house every Friday.
- At 6:30pm, we eat dinner and socialize.
- At 7:00pm, the game starts.
- If you are going to be late and have told me in advance, I will wait up until 7:15pm to start the game.
- If you are going to be late and have not told me, I will be starting at 7:00pm as usual.
- If you are going to be later than 7:30pm, do not attend. It is too disruptive. Just come and play next time instead.

## Bonus XP
I will award bonus XP for out of game activities as follows:
- 5% Bonus XP if you bring snacks or drinks
- 5% Bonus XP in your next session if you write a short session summary (200 words or less).
