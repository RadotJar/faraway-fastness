## English
- Breakfast at 512& for souffle pancakes. Definitely an expensive tourist trap but so nice and good coffee.
- Walked around, saw cute shop with little trinkets and patches etc. Lots of vintage stores and made sense for the fashion.
- Read about Osaka history and different districts a bit. Maybe mention castle history and siege.
- Dropped off car.
- Subwayed to Municipal Housing Museum directly. Huge arcade that couldn't see the end of and had yummy ramen.
