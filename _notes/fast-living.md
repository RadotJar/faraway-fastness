title: Fast Living

The way people live has become so fast that certain things have lost their value.

While viewing ancient works of calligraphy in Japan I was struck by the fact that nobody appreciates mundane writing such as government communications as an art form anymore. The speed of communication was so slow that people actually put effort into making the writing beautiful in form and content. You see this even with letter writing, committing some time to really think about what you want to say before you put pen to parchment. Its so different to the stream of conciousness communication we see today.
