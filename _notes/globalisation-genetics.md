ðŸŒ±

There are some issues with globalisation and human genetics.

Examples: The pigment of peoples' skins no longer always suit the environments they live in. People's diets no longer suit their physiology and the genetics can't develop fast enoug. Example is Samoans who store fat for longer periods of not eating. Now have high obesity rate with exposure to global foods.
