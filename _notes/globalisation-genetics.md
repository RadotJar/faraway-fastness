title: Subtle effects of Globalisation
---


There are some issues brought about by globalisation that I have noticed and think are more subtle or rarely discussed.

The pigment of peoples' skins no longer always suit the environments they live in. 

People's diets no longer suit their physiology and the genetics can't develop fast enough. Example is Samoans who store fat for longer periods of not eating. Now have high obesity rate with exposure to global foods.

One I found quite humerous after spending time in Japan is Chinese tourists speaking to local Japanese in broken English. Even though these two groups speak languages that are very closely related, they are conversing in a language from the other side of the world.
