ðŸŒ±

- Showing the consequence of player action is the single most important thing
- Always tell players more than your initial instinct, don't hide things unnecessarily
- Rules should support the story, not the other way around. Only roll when there's risk of failure and fail forward
- Players don't realise how little prep you've done
- You will always overprepare
- There will be good sessions and bad sessions
- Sometimes it will seem like you're the only one who cares. Stop and watch people, they keep coming back. You've just been assigned the organiser role
- Focus on one thing to improve on each session
